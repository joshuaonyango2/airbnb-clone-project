# Airbnb Clone – Booking Management System

A full-featured clone of Airbnb, focused on a robust **Booking Management System**. This project simulates a property rental platform with a modern frontend and a powerful Django-based backend API.

## 📖 Overview
The Airbnb Clone is a production-grade application designed to replicate the core functionality of a property rental platform. It emphasizes secure user authentication, property and booking management, payment processing, and user reviews, built with scalability and performance in mind.

## 🏆 Project Goals
- **🔐 User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **🏡 Property Listings**: Create, edit, and delete property listings.
- **📅 Booking System**: Manage bookings with conflict-free date selection.
- **💳 Payment Processing**: Secure payments via Stripe integration.
- **⭐ Review System**: Allow users to rate and review properties.
- **⚙️ Data Optimization**: Implement caching, indexing, and async tasks for performance.

🛠️ Technology Stack





Django: A Python web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs, handling user authentication, property management, and booking processes.



Django REST Framework (DRF): Extends Django to create scalable RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the backend and frontend.



PostgreSQL: A relational database system that stores and manages all project data, including users, properties, bookings, and reviews.



GraphQL: A query language that allows the frontend to fetch precise data efficiently, reducing over- or under-fetching compared to REST.



Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing user sessions to enhance performance.



Celery: A task queue that handles asynchronous background tasks, such as sending confirmation emails and processing payments.



Docker: A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different systems.



GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool that automates testing, linting, building, and deployment workflows to streamline development.
**Team Roles**

**Backend Developer:** Implements API endpoints, business logic, and integrates with databases and third-party services like Stripe, ensuring robust and scalable backend functionality.

**Database Administrator:** Designs and optimizes the PostgreSQL database schema, manages indexes, and ensures data consistency, security, and performance.

**DevOps Engineer:** Configures Docker containers, sets up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and manages deployment, monitoring, and scaling of services.

**QA Engineer:** Tests features through manual and automated methods, verifies functionality, and ensures the system meets performance, security, and usability requirements.
