Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Booking Management System
A full-featured clone of Airbnb, focused on a robust Booking Management System. This project simulates a property rental platform with a modern frontend and a powerful Django-based backend API.

**üìñ Overview**
The Airbnb Clone is a production-grade application designed to replicate the core functionality of a property rental platform. It emphasizes secure user authentication, property and booking management, payment processing, and user reviews, built with scalability and performance in mind.
üèÜ Project Goals

**üîê User Management:** Secure registration, login, and profile management.

**üè° Property Listings:** Create, edit, and delete property listings.

**üìÖ Booking System:** Manage bookings with conflict-free date selection.

**üí≥ Payment Processing:** Secure payments via Stripe integration.

**‚≠ê Review System:** Allow users to rate and review properties.

**‚öôÔ∏è Data Optimization:** Implement caching, indexing, and async tasks for performance.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**

**Django:** A Python web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs, handling user authentication, property management, and booking processes.

**Django REST Framework (DRF):** Extends Django to create scalable RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the backend and frontend.

**PostgreSQL:** A relational database system that stores and manages all project data, including users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

**GraphQL:** A query language that allows the frontend to fetch precise data efficiently, reducing over- or under-fetching compared to REST.

**Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing user sessions to enhance performance.

**Celery:** A task queue that handles asynchronous background tasks, such as sending confirmation emails and processing payments.

**Docker:** A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different systems.

**GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD tool that automates testing, linting, building, and deployment workflows to streamline development.

**üë• Team Roles**

**Backend Developer:** Implements API endpoints, business logic, and integrates with databases and third-party services like Stripe, ensuring robust and scalable backend functionality.

**Database Administrator:** Designs and optimizes the PostgreSQL database schema, manages indexes, and ensures data consistency, security, and performance.

**DevOps Engineer:** Configures Docker containers, sets up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and manages deployment, monitoring, and scaling of services.

**QA Engineer:** Tests features through manual and automated methods, verifies functionality, and ensures the system meets performance, security, and usability requirements.

**üß± Database Design**
The database is designed to support the core functionality of the booking system, with the following key entities and their relationships:
Entities & Fields

**Users**
id : Unique identifier for each user.
name: Full name of the user.
email: User‚Äôs email address for login and notifications.
password: Hashed password for secure authentication.
is_host (Boolean): Indicates if the user can list properties.


**Properties**
id (UUID): Unique identifier for each property.
user_id (Foreign Key to Users): Links the property to its host.
title: Name or title of the property listing.
location: Address or geographic details of the property.
price_per_night: Cost per night for renting the property.


**Bookings**
id : Unique identifier for each booking.
user_id (Foreign Key to Users): Links the booking to the guest.
property_id (Foreign Key to Properties): Links the booking to the rented property.
check_in: Start date of the stay.
check_out: End date of the stay.


**Reviews**
id (UUID): Unique identifier for each review.
user_id (Foreign Key to Users): Links the review to the reviewer.
property_id (Foreign Key to Properties): Links the review to the reviewed property.
rating: Numerical score (e.g., 1-5) for the property.
comment: Text description of the user‚Äôs experience.


**Payments**
id : Unique identifier for each payment.
booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings): Links the payment to a specific booking.
amount: Total payment amount.
status: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed, failed).



**Relationships**

A User can have multiple Properties (one-to-many, as a host).
A Property can have multiple Bookings and Reviews (one-to-many).
A Booking belongs to one User (guest) and one Property (many-to-one).
A Review belongs to one User (reviewer) and one Property (many-to-one).
A Payment is linked to one Booking (many-to-one).

**üß© Feature Breakdown**
The project includes the following core features, each contributing to a seamless property rental experience:

User Management: Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and host verification. It ensures secure access control and session management, forming the foundation for personalized user interactions.
Property Management: Enables hosts to create, edit, view, and delete property listings with details like images, descriptions, and prices. This feature empowers hosts to showcase their rentals effectively, driving platform engagement.
Booking System: Allows users to select dates and book properties while preventing scheduling conflicts. It manages the booking lifecycle, ensuring a smooth and reliable reservation process for guests.
Payment Integration: Facilitates secure payment processing through Stripe, linking payments to bookings. This feature ensures safe and efficient transactions, building trust in the platform.
Review System: Permits users to leave ratings and comments after their stay. It fosters trust and transparency by providing feedback that helps users make informed booking decisions.

**üîí API Security**
The project implements robust security measures to protect the backend APIs and ensure a secure user experience:

**Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identities, ensuring only logged-in users can access protected endpoints. This is crucial for protecting user data, such as personal information and booking history, from unauthorized access.

**Authorization:** Implements role-based permissions to distinguish between user and host functionalities, restricting actions like property management to verified hosts. This ensures system integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications to listings or bookings.

**Rate Limiting:** Restricts the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This maintains platform availability and performance, ensuring a reliable experience for all users.

**Input Validation & Sanitization:** Validates and sanitizes all user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This is essential for securing payments and user data, ensuring compliance with legal standards and maintaining user trust.

**‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline**
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the testing, building, and deployment of code changes, ensuring high-quality software delivery. In this project, CI/CD pipelines reduce bugs, accelerate development, and maintain a reliable deployment process by catching issues early and enabling rapid iteration. The tools used include GitHub Actions for automating linting, testing, and deployment workflows, Docker for consistent containerized environments, and PostgreSQL and Redis services for integration testing within CI workflows.
